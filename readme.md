This project should work as simple gui front-end for windows users, and help them to use youtube-dl.
Currently it is working on linux, but not good is rendering quality and scroll.
It can download videos from websites 
BUT
!! not integration on windows

I used golang's fyne framework, may be I should change it and use webview, I am not sure.

You need to have youtube-dl and ffmpeg on your local machine to make this program work
